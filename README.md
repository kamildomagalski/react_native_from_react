> My first mobile app based on Emmanuel Henri tutorial: [From React to React Native](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=2113185&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Ffrom-react-to-react-native-14332800%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DI4rFcmveSWG1vehosMVvgA%253D%253D)


## General info

This is a simple app with info about coding tutorials prepared by Emmanuel Henri. 
The point was to convert traditional webb app into mobile one, and see how they are differ. 
Theres no advanced styling, top tier mobile coding practices or folder structure.<br />
Just a 'proof of concept" for myself.

## Setup
### Set up an environment
Go to the site [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) site and follow steps 1-4. 
### In react_native folder run `npm install`
To start you have to install locally all packages using npm.
### Open your Android emulator 
### `npx react-native start`
Runs Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.
### `npx react-native run-android`
Open new terminal and start your application.<br />
If everything is set up correctly you should see app in your emulator shortly.

The app will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Status
Project is: _deprecated_, as it was only a spin-off for my React Native adventure :wink:
